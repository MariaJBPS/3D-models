# 3D-models

I really enjoy doing 3D modelling too! The first zip has a few 3D models which would be used as game assets for the fictional `Pirates Ship` game. 
See more details about the case study in the assets library document. I've put up a detailed documentation on how I've created the models in this repo. 
I've also modelled a velociraptor just because! :D
