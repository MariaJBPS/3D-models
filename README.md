# 3D-models

I really enjoy doing 3D modelling too! The first zip has a few 3D models which would be used as game assets for the fictional `Pirates Ship` game. 
See more details about the case study in the remaining files. I have also put up a detailed documentation and how I've created the models in this repo. 
I also modelled a velociraptor just because! :D
